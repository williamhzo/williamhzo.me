## General

- This project uses `bun` (not `npm`, not `yarn`)

## TypeScript

- Only create an abstraction if it’s actually needed
- Prefer clear function/variable names over inline comments
- Avoid helper functions when a simple inline expression would suffice
- Use `knip` to remove unused code after making large changes
- The `gh` CLI is installed, use it
- Don’t use emojis
- Don’t unnecessarily add `try`/`catch`
- Don’t cast to `any`

## React

- Avoid massive JSX blocks and compose smaller components
- Colocate code that changes together
- Avoid `useEffect` unless absolutely needed

## Tailwind

- Mostly use built-in values, occasionally allow dynamic values, rarely globals
- Always use v4 global CSS file format shadcn/ui

## Next

- Prefer fetching data in RSC (page can still be static)
- Use next/font next/script when applicable
- next/image above the fold should have `sync` / `eager` / use `priority` sparingly
- Be mindful of serialized prop size for RSC → child components
