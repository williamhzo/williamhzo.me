Behind this catchy headline lies a mental shift I’ve observed at some point, which changed how I see static design assets (like [Sketch](oversights) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) wireframes), and therefore how I write CSS and build User Interfaces.

Building for the web today means that we ship websites that work for everyone, regardless of the end user’s device: a shiny new MacBook Pro, a 5K display, a smartwatch, or even the [screen of a fridge](https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/family-hub-refrigerator/overview/).

  Building for everyone also means shipping experiences that are great
  regardless of the end user's disabilities and network connection, but that's
  another topic.

## The illusion of the source of truth

Wireframes are often seen as the unique, irrefutable _source of truth_. In that sense spacings, font sizes, line heights, widths, and heights (to name a few) would need to be a perfect 1:1 match between design assets and production code.

This is often flagged as "pixel-perfect" development: when given a "final" design (i.e. approved by stakeholders), the developer's job would only be to implement it following the exact same pixel values in the wireframes.

This coupled with the fact that some teams work in a traditional linear way regarding a project's lifecycle, something along the lines of:

1. research
2. sketches/prototypes/low-fidelity wireframes
3. iteration
4. high-fidelity wireframes
5. integration/development

This means developers (or engineers, depending on the team) are invited very late to the party, and therefore most of the project's lifecycle is done within the design tools (steps 1 to 4).

  Their input is therefore limited, and crucial aspects of the design will have
  most probably been left off and overseen: accessibility issues, inconsistent
  content structure, complex and/or heavy interactions, missing states for
  elements (focused, hovered, in error, etc.), the list can go on forever. But
  that's also a whole other topic, I plan to write about it soon.

All this contributes to the fact that design assets are considered a specification and a unique source of truth, meaning that deviation from these specs is considered harmful and not desirable.

## But... design assets are static

Most designs are done on a canvas with fixed height and width, which means that [responsiveness](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) is simulated by multiplying the design on several canvases with different heights and widths.

For example, design files will contain a canvas for a mobile viewport (screen size), one for a tablet, and another one for a desktop.

These values are often arbitrary and tend to represent the average device size, such as, for example:

- mobile: 375 x 629px (iPhone 12)
- tablet: 584 x 806px (Galaxy Tab S7+)
- desktop: 1280 x 800px (average laptop)

But what happens for all the devices with screen sizes in-between or out of the limits above?

As mentioned by Andy Bell's [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/), there are _thousands of different devices_ out there in the wild, each and every one with its unique viewport. We have no clue on which screen size our website will be viewed.

## The illusion of control

The traditional way of dealing with this is adding [`width` media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/width) in our CSS on the breakpoints provided by the design. In that way, we ensure that for every device size provided in the wireframes, the design is the same.

We managed to control exactly when to wrap this sidebar, or these navigation menu items, the exact way that they were thought by the designer.

But it feels clunky.

Of course, our users will likely not resize browser windows to test responsiveness, but media query breakpoints rarely solve (nor detect) visual bugs and inconsistencies in the UI: large horizontal spacing right after wrapping an element, or some decreased `font-size` for a mobile phone screen that feels too small for a tablet.

## Letting go of pixel-perfect

The end user doesn't care if the production code reflects 1:1 the sizes provided in the design assets. The end user cares about _optimal_, _consistent_, and _intuitive_ experiences.

CSS is awesome. Our browsers are very capable nowadays and are very good at interpolating values with the right input.

The solution to this lies in accepting not controlling every absolute pixel value but providing hints to the browser by defining a fluid scale and layout on which to rely.

Instead of defining breakpoints on which to change the layout, we let the `flex` or `grid` algorithms do it for us, according to our input and the content they hold.

Some amazing tools and methodologies exist nowadays to achieve this. I'll briefly talk about 2 of my favorite in the next sections.

### Solving the fluid layout issue

Enter [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/). This is a goldmine of pure CSS utilities to build fluid robust layouts, _without any media queries_.

As the name states, (almost) all the basic layouts are covered and are easily configurable with CSS variables. It's not a library nor a framework, just good old plain CSS to drop in our project.

### Solving the fluid spacing and font sizes

One of the key discoveries from [buildexcellentwebsit.es](https://buildexcellentwebsit.es/) is the amazing tool [Utopia](https://utopia.fyi/).

Utopia allows you to generate CSS variables on fluid scales. You provide a target `font-size` for the smallest and largest viewports along with a [type scale](https://type-scale.com/), and it will generate for you all the intermediate sizes, thanks to the powerful [`clamp()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) CSS function.

## Wrapping up

I don't consider media queries as a code smell per se, but in the name of control and absolute loyalty to design wireframes, we overuse them.

They're a perfect example of trying to imperatively style every element in the UI, whereas CSS is designed to be declarative — Jeremy Keith puts it way better than I do in his [dedicated blog post](https://adactio.com/journal/18982).

Quick note after re-reading this post: the reasons above are the very same reasons why Tailwind doesn't really click for me, imperative vs declarative.
