## Introduction

Imagine building apps & onchain experiments where you as a creator get rewarded directly when users interact with your smart contracts: that's Shape in a nutshell.

Shape is a culture-first L2 that's home for art, crazy experiments, onchain games, you name it. It is neutral land, with an ever-growing community of creators, artists, builders, collectors and tinkerers.

This is a quick walkthrough to get you up and running building on Shape, from your dApp frontend to smart contracts deployment.

## Why Build on Shape?

- **Gasback**: Earn back 80% of network fees as a creator: perfect for rewarding user engagement. [More about Gasback](https://docs.shape.network/gasback).
- **Powering the new NFT economy**: NFTs that live on Shape are composable, interoperable, and alive. Shape is neutral land for NFTs: it's a community-owned protocol built by and for decentralization maxis. More [here](https://shape.network/why).
- **Security and Scalability**: Inherits Ethereum's security while offering faster, cheaper transactions via [the Superchain](https://www.superchain.eco/).
- **EVM-Compatible**: Drop in your favorite Ethereum tools: no weird tweaks needed.
- **Home for creators**: Low fees make it easy to experiment with NFTs, games, or whatever wild idea you have.
- **Active community**: Get your first users, some support & feedback in [Shape's Discord](https://discord.com/invite/shape-l2). Our Shapers community is composed of genuine NFT lovers: artists, collectors, builders & tinkerers, not short-sighted farmers.

## Prerequisites

- Assume: Basic **TypeScript**, **React** and **Git** knowledge (if not, feel free to give your fav LLM a call).
- For smart contracts: Familiarity with **Solidity** (we'll keep it simple; if completely new, check out [ethereum.org/smart-contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/smart-contracts/)).
- Tools needed:
  - Accounts: [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com) has a great set of tools to cover most needs (NFT API, Smart Wallet, etc.) and [WalletConnect](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) for multi-wallet support, with great DX.
  - Your current IDE of choice: **Cursor**, **VSCode**, **Windsurf**, **Notepad.exe**, etc.
- **Time estimate**: 5-25 minutes depending on how fast you read and copy-paste stuff.

<em>
  The apps frontend (Nextjs + WAGMI) sends JSON-RPC requests to the RPC provider
  (Alchemy), which forwards them to the Shape L2 network and then relays the
  responses back to your app.

## Cloning and Running the [Builder Kit](https://github.com/shape-network/builder-kit)

We've made this starter template to help builders get up and running in no time: [github.com/shape-network/builder-kit](https://github.com/shape-network/builder-kit). It's an opinionated repository based on React, Next.js & Wagmi.

1. **Clone the repo**: `git clone https://github.com/shape-network/builder-kit.git`
2. **Install deps**: `cd builder-kit && yarn install`
3. **Get your API keys/IDs**: [Alchemy API key](https://www.alchemy.com/docs/reference/api-overview) (for connecting to Shape's blockchain data) and your [WalletConnect project ID](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) (for wallet integrations).
4. **Env setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`, fill in your Alchemy key and WalletConnect ID. Set chain to Shape Sepolia Testnet (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11011` for safe experimenting).
5. **Run locally**: `yarn dev`; open http://localhost:3000 on your browser.

---

<em>
  Use Shape's testnet (Sepolia, Chain ID `11011`) for all experiments; it's free
  and safer to play around before hitting mainnet (Chain ID `360`). By the way,
  you can find all chain-related network information [in Shape
  docs](https://docs.shape.network/technical-details/network-information).
</em>

---

You'll have an app ready with wallet connect, balance checks, and Shape network support. Experiment on testnet first ‚Äì tweak the UI, connect a wallet, and see live data. You can also add some onchain interactions (read/write).

If you need to write onchain or deploy a contract you'll need Shape Sepolia ETH, you can get some on the [Optimism Superchain Faucet](https://console.optimism.io/faucet) or check out [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/shape-sepolia)'s.

## Building Your First Frontend Feature

Add a toggle to switch between Shape testnet and mainnet ‚Äì great for testing environments. Shape chains are pre-added in the Builder Kit config. If you start from scratch, add them to `wagmiConfig` first.

Add the following `network-toggle.tsx` component to `app/page.tsx`:

```tsx
"use client";

import { useSwitchNetwork, useChainId } from "wagmi";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

function NetworkToggle() {
  const chainId = useChainId();
  const { switchNetwork } = useSwitchNetwork();

  const isTestnet = chainId === 11011;
  const targetChainId = isTestnet ? 360 : 11011;

  return (
    <Button onClick={() => switchNetwork?.(targetChainId)}>
      Switch to {isTestnet ? "Mainnet" : "Testnet"}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Deploying Your First Smart Contract

You can use either Hardhat (JavaScript-based, great for beginners and integration) or Foundry (Rust-based, faster for testing). We'll use Hardhat here as it aligns well with the JavaScript stack in the Builder Kit.

For secure contracts, start with OpenZeppelin templates; they're audited and battle-tested, especially for NFTs (e.g., ERC721).

### Setup Hardhat Project

1. Create a new folder: `mkdir shape-contract && cd shape-contract`
2. Init: `yarn init -y` && `yarn add --dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`
3. Run init: `npx hardhat init` (choose `Create a TypeScript project`)
4. Add Shape network to `hardhat.config.ts`:

```ts
networks: {
  shapeTestnet: {
    url: "https://sepolia.shape.network",
    chainId: 11011,
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
  },
  shapeMainnet: {
    url: "https://mainnet.shape.network",
    chainId: 360,
    accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
  }
}
```

### Basic Example: Greeting Contract

In `contracts/Greeting.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

contract Greeting {
    string public greet = "Hello Shape!";
}
```

Deploy script in `scripts/deploy.ts`:

```ts
import { ethers } from "hardhat";

async function main() {
  const Greeting = await ethers.getContractFactory("Greeting");
  const greeting = await Greeting.deploy();
  await greeting.waitForDeployment();
  console.log(`Deployed to: ${await greeting.getAddress()}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

Run: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network shapeTestnet`

### NFT Example with OpenZeppelin

Install: `yarn add @openzeppelin/contracts`

In `contracts/MyNFT.sol`:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract MyNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
    uint256 private _tokenIdCounter;

    constructor(address initialOwner) ERC721("MyNFT", "MNFT") Ownable(initialOwner) {}

    function mint(address to) external onlyOwner {
        _safeMint(to, _tokenIdCounter);
        _tokenIdCounter++;
    }
}
```

Update deploy script accordingly.

Nice! Now you can check your deployed contract on [Shape Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.shapescan.xyz/)
